**# Data-Science-Assignment:eCommerce Transactions Dataset**
**# Overview**
This repository contains the code and results for a data science assignment based on an eCommerce transactions dataset. The assignment consists of three tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Model, and Customer Segmentation (Clustering).

**Tasks**

**Task 1:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

**Objective:**
Perform EDA on the provided eCommerce dataset, which includes customer, product, and transaction data. Derive meaningful business insights based on the analysis.

**Steps:**

Perform EDA on the dataset.
Create relevant visualizations (e.g., customer distribution by region, top-selling products, revenue by category).
Derive at least five business insights from the analysis.

**Deliverables:**
A Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code and visualizations.
A PDF report summarizing the business insights.

**Task 2**: Lookalike Model

**Objective:**
Build a Lookalike Model that recommends similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.

**Steps:**

Use customer and product information to calculate similarity scores.
Recommend the top 3 similar customers for each of the first 20 customers.
Save the results in a CSV file that maps each customer to their most similar customers and scores.

**Deliverables:**
A Jupyter Notebook containing the Lookalike Model code.
A CSV file with the lookalike recommendations.

**Task 3**: Customer Segmentation / Clustering

**Objective:**
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Use both customer profile and transaction data to segment customers into distinct clusters.

**Steps:**

Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers based on relevant features.
Evaluate the clustering results using metrics like Davies-Bouldin Index and Silhouette Score.
Visualize the clusters using 2D and 3D plots.

**Deliverables:**
A Jupyter Notebook containing the clustering code and visualizations.
A CSV file with the customer segmentation results.

**Evaluation Criteria**

**Task 1: EDA**
**Clarity of Insights:** How well the insights are derived and how actionable they are for the business.
**Visualizations:** Use of appropriate plots to visualize the data and support the insights.

**Task 2: Lookalike Model**
**Model Accuracy:** How well the similarity score matches customer profiles.
**Quality of Recommendations:** Relevance of the top 3 recommended customers.
**Clarity of Code:** Code readability and explanation in the Jupyter Notebook.

**Task 3: Customer Segmentation**
**Clustering Logic:** Appropriateness of the chosen clustering algorithm and features.
**Clustering Metrics:** Evaluation using metrics like Davies-Bouldin Index and Silhouette Score.
**Visual Representation:** Clarity of the cluster visualizations.

**Conclusion**
This repository contains a comprehensive data science project focused on eCommerce data. The tasks cover essential areas of analysis, model building, and customer segmentation. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your use case.
